# AI Movie Recommendation System

This project is an AI-driven movie recommendation system that delivers *personalized movie suggestions* to users based on their preferences, viewing history, and content similarity using machine learning.

## Features

- Personalized movie recommendations
- User-based or content-based filtering
- Trained AI model using movie metadata
- Matchmaking logic to recommend top picks
- Simple Python/Flask or Streamlit frontend (optional)

## Tech Stack

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Flask / Streamlit (for interface)
- Pickle (for saving model)
- Jupyter Notebook (for development)

## How It Works

1. *Preprocess* movie dataset (genre, actors, directors, etc.)
2. Use *TF-IDF* or *cosine similarity* for content-based filtering
3. Build a recommendation engine using machine learning
4. Serve recommendations based on user input or preferences

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-movie-recommendation.git
cd ai-movie-recommendation
pip install -r requirements.txt
